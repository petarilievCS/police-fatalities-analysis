# Fatal Force Analysis

This project contains a Jupyter Notebook where we perform a comprehensive analysis of fatal force incidents in the United States.

## Overview

The analysis covers various aspects such as:

1. **Poverty Rates vs High School Graduation Rates**: We analyze the relationship between poverty rates and high school graduation rates using line charts, scatter plots, and regression plots.

2. **Racial Makeup**: We visualize the racial makeup of each US state using a bar chart with sub-sections.

3. **Fatalities by Race**: We create a donut chart to show the race of people killed by police and a bar chart to show the total number of people killed by race.

4. **Gender Analysis**: We compare the total number of deaths of men and women using a pie chart and create a box plot to show the age and manner of death, categorized by gender.

5. **Armed Status**: We analyze the percentage of people armed and create a bar chart to show the armed status.

6. **Age Distribution**: We calculate the percentage of people under 25 years old and create a histogram and KDE plot to visualize the age distribution. We also create separate KDE plots for each race to compare the age distributions.

7. **Mental Illness**: We calculate the percentage of people killed by police who have been diagnosed with a mental illness.

8. **City-wise Analysis**: We create a bar chart to rank the top 10 cities with the most police killings. We also calculate the rate of death by race for each city and visualize it using a bar chart.

9. **State-wise Analysis**: We create a choropleth map to show police killings by US state.

10. **Temporal Trends**: We analyze the number of police killings over time and observe a decreasing trend.

## Data Source

The data used in this analysis is sourced from The Washington Post's database of fatal force incidents in the United States.

## Libraries Used

The analysis is performed using Python and several libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and plotly.
